- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alya-TheDA
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data manipulations across different tools and platforms such as Excel spreadsheet, SQL, R via Rstudio and more!
- ðŸŒ± My background in Industrial engineering planted a seed that has been growing ever since towards my knowledge and enthusiasm in Statistics, Forecasting
and over all data analysis from defining a problem or a business objective through:
asking the right questions, collecting samples, cleaning data, creating insightful Vizzes and finally sharing my analysis findings and future recommendations.
